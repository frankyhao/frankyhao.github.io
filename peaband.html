                    <p>Peaband is a conceptual wearable device product created by Fred JingYu Zheng, Wendy WanQin Wen, Susan
                        Yi Cao, and Frankie Hao Yuan in 2016. They were high school students at Beijing Bayi School International
                        Department(BYID), and this product is for Diamond Challenge, a business concept competition held
                        by University of Delaware. Helped by their advisor, Martin Thompson, these group of high school students
                        with enthusiasm were one of the three teams advanced into the semi-final via internet pitch. And
                        they were invited to Delaware to participate the Youth Entrepreneurship Summit (YES!).

                                <p>Steve Jobs said "I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should
                                    go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's
                                    next." So we asked ourselves, what is next? What is New EXciting Technology?
                                    <p>Technology today, in the form of computers and mobile phones bring us so many conveniences.
                                        We can get whatever information whenever we want it, ... just not necessarily WHERE
                                        we want it. Where is the easiest and the most convenient place for a person to look
                                        for and access information?
                                        <h2>Apperance</h2>
                                        <span class="image main">
                                            <img src="peaband/images/1.jpg" alt="">
                                        </span>
                                        <p>For the appearance, our design strategy is to be concise and functional. The Pea
                                            Module has a tritium self-luminous light to make the band dramatically beautiful.
                                            The Pea module has a curved AMOLED Screen with two smart ports that can be USB
                                            of two sizes or other proprietary ports licensed from other manufacturers. And
                                            we use smooth aluminum alloy to make it beautiful and comfortable.
                                            <h2>The Basics</h2>
                                            <span class="image main">

                                            </span>
                                            <p>As for basic functions, Pea Band will notify you when a phone call or new message
                                                arrives. You can also ask your phone's digital assistant through the Pea
                                                module to navigate for you, and the navigation information will be updated
                                                on the band.
                                                <h2>Health Care</h2>

                                                </span>
                                                <p>Pea Band does more for our health. It will collect all your exercise data
                                                    and transmit to your smart phone. The application on the phone will give
                                                    you a suitable plan for exercising, and this plan will adjust automatically
                                                    according to your true performance. Do you always forget to put your
                                                    phone under your pillow at night to monitor your sleep habits? Worry

                                                    analyzing, the Pea Band will wake you at the best time in your sleeping
                                                    cycle.
